#Swift Metal Test

Repositories for checking out git while doing the Metal with Swift tutorial from Ray Wenderlich.

* Tutorial part 1 Getting Started: https://www.raywenderlich.com/77488/ios-8-metal-tutorial-swift-getting-started 
* Tutorial part 2 Moving to 3D: https://www.raywenderlich.com/81399/ios-8-metal-tutorial-swift-moving-to-3d
* Tutorial part 3 Adding Texture: https://www.raywenderlich.com/93997/ios-8-metal-tutorial-swift-part-3-adding-texture

In part 2, are using float4x4 from part 5 insted of Matrix4. And in the end of part 3 are I moving from loading the texture with MetalTexture.swift to use the MetalKit and its MTKTextureLoader, this also from part 5.
